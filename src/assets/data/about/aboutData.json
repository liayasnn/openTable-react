        "subtitle": "The Impact of Migration on Chinese Children.",
        "paragraph": "In China, the lure of economic opportunities drives many parents from rural areas to urban centers, leaving behind their children and elderly relatives. This mass rural-to-urban migration is fueled by the promise of better-paying jobs but is constrained by China's hukou system, which ties access to essential services like education and healthcare to legal residency. As a result, parents often choose to leave their children in rural areas under the care of grandparents or other relatives, ensuring continued access to vital resources. However, this separation presents challenges, particularly in education. Rural schools are often under-resourced and located far from villages, requiring children to embark on long walks to reach them. Moreover, the quality of education in these areas may be lacking, depriving left-behind children of opportunities for proper academic development. Thus, while parents migrate in pursuit of economic security, their children often bear the brunt of limited educational opportunities and the hardships of rural life."

        "paragraph": "In a heartwarming workshop organized by Volunteers, children were asked to draw from their memories the dish their parents made that they miss the most or their favorite activity to do with their parents. With colored pencils in hand, the children eagerly sketched scenes that captured the essence of their cherished moments with their parents. Some depicted the aroma of their favorite meal filling the kitchen, while others illustrated joyful outings with their parents. Amidst laughter and storytelling, the workshop became a celebration of love and connection. Each drawing served as a poignant reminder of the enduring bond between parent and child, a testament to the power of love to transcend distance and time."
